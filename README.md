# Twitter Trend Analysis
# Description
Twitter Trend Analysis is a 6-week data science internship project under InternPro. The objective is to analyze Twitter data to uncover emerging trends, popular hashtags, and shifts in public sentiment using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.<br>


The project involves collecting tweets, cleaning and preprocessing the text, performing sentiment analysis with VADER, conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), identifying trend patterns, and finally visualizing the findings through Power BI dashboards and Python plots.<br>

This real-time team-based project replicates an end-to-end data science pipeline — from raw data to insights — and aims to deliver actionable understanding of social media behavior around trending topics.<br>
